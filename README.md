# Machine_Learning_Site_Calibration
Project consisting in a new Site Calibration methodology for wind turbines from data pre-processing to errors analysis.
Three datasets are analysed namely Dataset1, Dataset2 and Dataset3 with between 2 to 4 wind turbines each.
The steps of the project are devided in 4: Preprocessing, Preparation, Modelling (Linear Regression, Aritificial Neural Networks and XGBoost) and AEP study.
